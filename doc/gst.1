.SH NAME
Smalltalk \- the GNU Smalltalk virtual machine
.SH DESCRIPTION
GNU Smalltalk usage:
.IP
gst [ flag ... ] [ file ... ]
gst [ flag ... ] { \fB\-f\fR | \fB\-\-file\fR } file [ args ... ]
.PP
Short flags can appear either as \fB\-xyz\fR or as \fB\-x\fR \fB\-y\fR \fB\-z\fR.  If an option is
mandatory for a long option, it is also mandatory for a short one. The
currently defined set of flags is:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fB\-\-smalltalk\-args\fR
Pass the remaining arguments to Smalltalk.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fB\-\-core\-dump\fR
Dump core on fatal signal.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR \fB\-\-declaration\-trace\fR
Trace compilation of all loaded files.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR \fB\-\-execution\-trace\fR
Trace execution of all loaded files.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR \fB\-\-no\-gc\-message\fR
Do not print garbage collection messages.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fB\-\-rebuild\-image\fR
Ignore the image file; rebuild it from scratch.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR \fB\-\-image\-file\fR FILE
Instead of `gst.im', use FILE as the image
file, and ignore the kernel files' timestamps.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR \fB\-\-kernel\-file\fR FILE
Make FILE's path relative to the image path.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR \fB\-\-quiet\fR \fB\-\-silent\fR
Do not print execution information.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fB\-\-regression\-test\fR
Run in regression test mode, i.e. make
printed messages constant.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fB\-\-snapshot\fR
Save a snapshot just before exiting.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the Smalltalk version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print names of loaded files and execution stats.
.TP
\fB\-\-emacs\-mode\fR
Execute as a `process' (from within Emacs)
.TP
\fB\-\-image\-dir\fR DIR
Look for the image in directory DIR.
.TP
\fB\-\-kernel\-dir\fR DIR
Look for kernel files in directory DIR.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-user\-files\fR
Don't read user customization files.
.TP
-
Read input from standard input explicitly.
.PP
Files are loaded one after the other.  After the last one is loaded,
Smalltalk will exit.  If no files are specified, Smalltalk reads from
the terminal, with prompts.
.PP
In the second form, the file after \fB\-f\fR is the last loaded file; any
parameter after that file is passed to the Smalltalk program.
