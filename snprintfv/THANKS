libsnprintfv would not be what it is without the invaluable help of
these people:

Everybody who was kind enough to spend time testing libsnprintfv,
use it in their packages and report bugs.

The following people made especially gracious contributions of their
time and energy in helping to track down bugs, port to new systems,
and generally assist in the maintainership process:

Bruce Korb <bkorb@gnu.org>
Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>
Robert Lipe <robertlipe@usa.net>
